# @sparser/au2-data-grid

This is a data-grid that can be used in [Aurelia2](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia) applications.
The grids can be defined completely in markup which gives you the freedom of using your own awesome Aurelia2 custom elements, instead of writing a tons of configuration code.

Moreover, the following features are also supported:

- Configurable item selection: single as well as multiple or none.
- Static content or content backed with backend services (does not provide any HTTP pipeline; thus, giving freedom of reusing your own HTTP pipeline).
- Page-able content/data.
- Data can be sorted via callback.
- Columns can be reordered, without essentially rerendering the grid completely.
- Columns can be resized (also without rerendering the grid).

## Installation

```shell
npm install @sparser/au2-data-grid
